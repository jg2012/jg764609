My name is Jose Guzman and my pronouns are He/Him/His.   

I am currently attending a Backend Software Development Bootcamp through Promineo Tech.  I have 10+ years of expereince in I.T. working in various Helpdesk and Desktop support roles in higher-education and tech.  I decided to expand my skill set by starting the BackEnd bootcamp this summer. I am currently working on learning Java.  I'm excited to learn and grow from this experience.
