I recently graduated from a Backend Software Development and Data Engineering Bootcamp through Promineo Tech. I have 10+ years of experience in I.T., working in various Helpdesk and Desktop support roles in higher education and tech. I decided to expand my skillset with my BackEnd Bootcamp this and Data Engineering bootcamps.
